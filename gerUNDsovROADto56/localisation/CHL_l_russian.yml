 CHL_artillery:0 "Развитие артиллерии"

 CHL_rockets:0 "Ракетная техника"
 CHL_rockets_desc:0 "Our researchers have come to us with an interesting proposition: rockets. They say that the future of artillery lies in their exploitation.

 CHL_establish_the_airforce_desc:0 "Linea Aerea Nacional was established in 1932 under Carlos Ibáñez del Campo but, as yet, it is only a small fleet. The skies will prove a necessary battlefield and, as such, aircraft a necessary investment. Our military industrial complex cannot facilitate an enormous air force so we should focus on making the best use of what we have."
